**Setting up a Rocket.Chat server**
- To set up your Rocket.Chat server manually, follow these steps: [Local Development](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-local-development).
- To set it up using Docker, download the following `compose.yml` file: [Docker Image](https://github.com/RocketChat/Docker.Official.Image/blob/fb09fece013b05ce7c0d8a42b646543a75fda57a/compose.yml). Then, navigate to the directory where the file was downloaded and run the following command:
    ```sh
    docker compose up -d
    ```
    **Note:** If you encounter errors with `docker compose` while using an Apple Silicon device, follow the solution mentioned here: [Issues](https://github.com/RocketChat/Docker.Official.Image/issues/204).
