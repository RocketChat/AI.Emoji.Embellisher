# AI In-message Emoji Embellisher

Apps.Emoji.Embellisher is a Rocket.Chat app that will add emoji to an old-school plain text message. The app leverages modern open source LLMs (Mistral, Llama2, Phi, and so on) to inject the emojis. Users can adjust the level of embellishment, and can ask for a redo if needed. Users can make some small edits after emjois are added. The finally accepted message would be available to be injected into the current channel, shared to external application, or copied to system clipboard.
