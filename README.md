# AI In-message Emoji Embellisher

Text embellishment is a natural language generation problem that aims to enhance the lexical and syntactic complexity of a text while retaining the same semantic information and meaning. This is often achieved by incorporating emojis, punctuation, and additional details to make the text more interesting and engaging.

Apps.Emoji.Embellisher is a Rocket.Chat app that will add emoji to an old-school plain text message. The app leverages modern open source LLMs (Mistral, Llama2, Phi, and so on) to inject the emojis. Users can adjust the level of embellishment, and can ask for a redo if needed. Users can make some small edits after emjois are added. The finally accepted message would be available to be injected into the current channel, shared to external application, or copied to system clipboard.
